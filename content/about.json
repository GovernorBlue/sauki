    "aboutMe": "When not busy saving lives and writing witty prescriptions, you can find this doctor: \n\n Debunking health myths with a side of humor. \n Sharing expert advice that's easy to understand (and sometimes, easy to laugh at). \n Trying to convince patients that 'eat your veggies' isn't just a suggestion. ðŸ¥¦ \n So, sit back, relax, and let Dr. Blue be your go-to source for all things health and hilarity."
